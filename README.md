# React-Tic-Tac-Toe
 Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game implemented using React. This web-based version allows players to compete against each other by taking turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for winning combinations and announces the winner or a draw when the game ends.
